# Purescript-Gorebab

A wrapper around Redux-Observable providing well-typed `ofType` using the row of variants from `ActionVariant` in [`Purescript-Jolly-Pong`](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-jolly-pong/)

Like Jolly-Pong, this is meant to be used in times of desperation. Desperate times call for desperate measures, but you should probably try to plan your way out of those.

_The original suggestions for the name of this library were too cruel, so I had to use this instead._

## Help wanted

This has no examples really yet, since I'm lazy. Please help by adding some tests and usage examples!
